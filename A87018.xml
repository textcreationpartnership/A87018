            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> saith he, <hi>Justinian never intended to crop the aspiring growth of</hi> Rome, <hi>as the Dr. imagines, which is manifest by his sending to Pope</hi> Vigilius <hi>to bestow a Pall upon his new Archbishop.</hi>] And truly I never said <hi>Iustinian</hi> intended it; he intended only <hi>kindness,</hi> and to express that, <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to the <hi>place</hi> of his own <hi>birth, Achrida</hi> a City of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> making it an <hi>Archiepis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> See, and <hi>subjecting</hi> many regions to it, but leaving it <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to none, an <hi>image</hi> of his own <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or <hi>independent power.</hi> And this was no kind of <hi>diminution</hi> of that <hi>Patriarchal</hi> power, which <hi>Rome</hi> then had, the <hi>absoluteness</hi> of <hi>Primates</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as was shewed, <hi>reconcileable</hi> with that; and this that <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niana</hi> now had, being no more than such. And at this time, whilest <hi>Iustinian</hi> reigned, the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had not ascended to any greater <hi>sublimity</hi> then that of the first <hi>Patriarch,</hi> the title of <hi>universal Bishop,</hi> which signifies that <hi>unlimited</hi> power, and <hi>Pastorship,</hi> which is now pretended to, being the <hi>concession</hi> of <hi>Phocas</hi> to <hi>Boniface,</hi> after the reign of <hi>Iustinian.</hi> And therefore it signifies very little, what is here added for an <hi>evidence</hi> on <hi>S.

W.</hi> to witness <hi>subjection</hi> to the <hi>Papal power,</hi> but signified no such thing in <hi>Vigilius</hi> his time, and so is no prejudice to the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he will hope to get some advantage by our <hi>answer</hi> to this <hi>question, Whether all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, supreme Priesthood and supreme honor must mean a supremacy over the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whole Church, or only in his own particular dioecese?</hi> and supposing wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For he that is <hi>supreme</hi> within himself, and hath <hi>power finally</hi> to <hi>conclude</hi> all differences, within his own <hi>Province,</hi> so that there shall be no <hi>resort</hi> to any other, is certainly so <hi>supreme</hi> in his own <hi>Province,</hi> that he is not <hi>subiect</hi> to the <hi>Pope.</hi> And this was the <hi>express priviledge</hi> of <hi>Iustiniana,</hi> in the <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> set out by <hi>Gothofred, Dirimant, finem imponant, nec ad al um quemvis eatur;</hi> and if other <hi>Primates</hi> may have the same <hi>priviledge,</hi> and <hi>exemption</hi> from all forraign <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> I

First, that my words having on purpose designed to shew the likeness of our, and the unlikeness of the <hi>Romanists tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> to that of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and consequently the danger of <hi>schism</hi> to them from judging of us, if this be granted, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily it must, that this was <hi>Cyprians temper,</hi> and that this ought to be other mens <hi>temper</hi> also on the like occasions, this is all that I need ask in this matter. For that this rule should be no farther applicable than to the matter of the present <hi>difference</hi> betwixt <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> and others, concerning the <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi> of <hi>hereticks,</hi> or that it is not equally (by <hi>parity of reason</hi>) to be extended to all other <hi>differences</hi> which touch not the <hi>foundation,</hi> there is no other <hi>reason</hi> here tendred, but that this of <hi>rebaptization</hi> was not, but these other matters of <hi>difference</hi> between the <hi>Romanists</hi> and us are defined by the <hi>Church:</hi> To this then I <hi>answer,</hi> first, that the contrary to <hi>S. Cyprians</hi> opinion was at that time defined by the then-<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and earnestly maintained by him, and some others with him, as shall by and by appear. Secondly, that betwixt the <hi>Romanist</hi> and us, the <hi>question</hi> being principally this, whether the <hi>Romane Church</hi> have done well to enter so many new <hi>articles</hi> into their <hi>belief,</hi> and to exact the <hi>profession</hi> of them from all that are admitted to their <hi>Communion,</hi> quite contrary to the express <hi>interdict</hi> of the <hi>Ephesine Canon</hi> so often mentioned, and withall the matter of those <hi>articles</hi> being so farr from <hi>infallible</hi> or <hi>certain</hi> truth, that we doubt not to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of some of them, that they implie a <hi>contradiction,</hi> and so an <hi>impossibility</hi> to be true, and the ground on which all are founded at once, the <hi>Roman infallibility,</hi> being it self farr from being induced by any <hi>infallible medium;</hi> These things I say, being considered, I desire that <hi>Cyprians</hi> temper, may be compared with the <hi>temper</hi> of those that thus defined these <hi>articles de fide,</hi> and in what degree soever it shall appear, that the making those <hi>definitions de fide,</hi> and condemning and excluding all that cannot <hi>uprightly</hi> and <hi>cordially</hi> imbrace them, hath been <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>S.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Fifthly, when by that <hi>series</hi> of <hi>faith coming by hearing,</hi> that <hi>from preaching,</hi> that <hi>from mission,</hi> and supposing that <hi>mission</hi> is an <hi>act of jurisdiction,</hi> he will first inferr that our <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> have no <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> and then that we have neither <hi>mission, preaching, hearing,</hi> nor <hi>consequently Church]</hi> I shall make no stay to admire his <hi>logick,</hi> or extraordinary <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If he be not, from whence the <hi>invalidity</hi> or <hi>nullity</hi> of these <hi>latter</hi> acts proceed? If he be, what <hi>concludency</hi> then can be imagined in S. W. his argument? As for our resort to the <hi>secular power,</hi> how little that is to this matter, is shewed in the reply p. 157. and hath formerly been cleared in these papers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Sixthly, 'tis a little strange, that when I say of our <hi>present persecution,</hi> that the <hi>same tempest hath with us thrown out all order and forme, Bishops and Liturgie together,</hi> which visibly belongs to <hi>their</hi> reteining <hi>none</hi> of these, who have cast us out
